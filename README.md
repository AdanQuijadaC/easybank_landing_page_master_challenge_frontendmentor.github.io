## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup - Basic
- CSS custom properties -Basic
- Basic CSS Grid lvl 1
- Desktop-first workflow
- Libreries: None

### What I learned

I had difficulties trying to change the color of the icons or svg because the "fill" and "color" properties did not work for me, but with the "filter" property and pages like css-color-filter-generator, it is possible to change the color without the need to modify the source code of the svg.

### Useful resources
